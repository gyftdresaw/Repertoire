This module provides an implementation of Gale and Sampson's (1995/2001) "Simple
Good Turing" algorithm. The main function is simpleGoodTuringProbs(), which
takes a dictionary of species counts and returns the estimated population
frequencies of the species, as estimated by the Simple Good Turing method. To
use this module, you must have scipy and numpy installed.

Also included is a function that uses pylab and matplotlib to draw a useful
scatterplot for comparing the empirical frequencies against the Simple Good
Turing estimates.

Depends on reasonably recent versions of scipy and numpy.
